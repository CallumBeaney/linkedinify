This is just a bit of banter.  
The core functionality is a bookmarklet that adds extra line breaks in the HTML DOM to simulate the excessively-spaced format many Social Media Gurus use in their informative and valuable LinkedIn feed posts.  
It might actually make reading some articles easier and thereby not be totally useless(?).
